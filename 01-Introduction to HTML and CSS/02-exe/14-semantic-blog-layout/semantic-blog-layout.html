            <h3>New feature: JPEG XL image format</h3>
            <p>
                JPEG XL image format is a modern image format optimized for web environments. JPEG XL generally has
                better
                compression than WebP, JPEG, PNG and GIF and is designed to supersede them.

            <h3>New feature: Cookie Store API</h3>
            <p>
                Cookie Store API is a JS API for reading and modifying cookies. Compared to the existing
                `document.cookie`
                method,
                the API provides a much more modern interface, which can also be used in service workers.
